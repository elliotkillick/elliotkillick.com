Zola development serve to intranet (port forward from Qubes OS):
Dom0: ./qvm-portfwd-iptables-fepitre.sh --action create --qube website --port 1111
AppVM: zola serve -i 0.0.0.0 -u 192.168.0.2
    - -u affects what get_url() in Tera templating language returns, this should be the IP of sys-net
Temporarily comment out HTTPS upgrade CSP from templates/index.html

Substitute all external markdown hyperlinks for HTML hyperlinks with target=_blank:
sed -i -E 's/(.*)\[(([[:alnum:]]|[[:space:]]|[[:punct:]])+)\]\((http([[:alnum:]]|[[:punct:]])+)\)(.*)/\1<a href="\4" target="_blank">\2<\/a>\6/g' index.md
Adapted from: https://gist.github.com/mdonkers/e4d76ad619683195f106bc00a5bff1a5
Bug: If more than one hyperlink exists on the same line then only the first hyperlink will be substituted
Workaround: Run the sed command multiple times
Missing feature: Doesn't add "?ref=<DOMAIN>" to URLs (difficult to implement because it would have to account for cases of an already existing get parameter in the URL; ? or &amp; AND would have to be placed before any anchor; #)
<a href="https://example.com?ref=elliotonsecurity.com" target="_blank">HackerOne Report</a>
Workaround: Use new "a" (hyperlink) shortcode in the future to create hyperlinks: {{ a(l="https://example.com", q="?test=true", a="#test", t="Test123") }}

Get ECC certificate for ping.elliotkillick.com:
sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d ping.elliotkillick.com --key-type ecdsa
Certbot will now automatically renew this certificate.

Get ECC certificate for ring0mo.de:
sudo certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /home/ubuntu/serve/public -d ring0mo.de --key-type ecdsa
Ensure the Actix Files web server has use_hidden_files() enabled.
Certbot will now automatically renew this certificate.
However, you still have to reload ("systemctl reload" is equivalent to sending "SIGHUP") the server or reverse proxy for it to read the new certificate from disk into memory. I've implemented this in the rustls server.
