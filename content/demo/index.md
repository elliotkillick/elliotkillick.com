Here's a general demo of elliotonsecurity.com as rendered by Zola (a Rust powered static site generator) and how things look.

# Header I

Inline code: `println!("EOS!");`

Zola has built in syntax highlighting. If there's not a theme you like, you can
easily add more.

elliotonsecurity.com has Fira Code fonts, which means we get ligatures in addition to
Zola's powerful syntax highlighting âœ¨.

```rs
fn foo(arg: String) -> Result<u32, Io::Error> {
    println!("Nice!"); // TODO: More ligatures
    if 1 != 0 {
        println!("How many ligatures can I contrive??");
        println!("Turns out a lot! ==> -/-> <!-- <$> >>=");
    }
    Ok(42)
}
```

Here's lots of code:
